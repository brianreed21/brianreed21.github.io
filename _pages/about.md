I am a fourth-year PhD student in Energy & Environmental Economics at Stanford University. I use methods from economics and computer science to study ways to minimize the future impacts of climate change. 

I work primarily with John Weyant and the [Program on Coupled Human and Earth Systems](https://www.pches.psu.edu/). I also work with Ken Gillingham and the [Solutions for Energy, Air, Climate & Health (SEARCH) Center](https://search-center.yale.edu/).
