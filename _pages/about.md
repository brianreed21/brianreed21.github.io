I am a fourth-year PhD student in Energy & Environmental Economics at Stanford University, where I work with John Weyant as part of the [Program on Coupled Human and Earth Systems](https://www.pches.psu.edu/). I focus on the impacts of climate change in the nearer-term, over the coming years and decades. I am also working with Ken Gillingham to study the potential role of distributed solar energy generation, as part of the [Solutions for Energy, Air, Climate & Health (SEARCH) Center](https://search-center.yale.edu/).
