title: "The Economics of Crop Adaptation to Climate Change in South-East Asia"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/agAdapt1
excerpt: 'We examine the potential for farmers in South-East Asia to adapt to climate change using a survey of farmers from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. We model farmers’ current choices using cross-sectional analysis. We test the climate sensitivity of when to plant, which crop to plant, whether to irrigate, and how much inputs to use. We find that all these choices are sensitive to climate in this region. Farmers are likely to adapt to future climate change by growing more rice and oilseed crops, planting more often from November through March, and relying more heavily on ground water irrigation for water short seasons.'
